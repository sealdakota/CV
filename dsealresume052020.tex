\section{Hobbies and Interests}
I enjoy spending a lot of my time out doors. During the summer I enjoy hiking, backpacking, golf, and frisbee, 
with one of my favorite spots to go backpacking being the Sawtooths. During the winter I like to ski 
(and sometimes snowboard) and often go to either Bogus, Tamarack, or Brundage. I also enjoy rock climbing/bouldering 
and frequent the climbing gym Asana year round. When I'm not outdoors I like to tinker with amateur science projects 
or DIY projects (I've helped build cloud chambers, homemade fireworks, electrical metal melters, and more), hang out 
with friends, or simply relax with a movie or TV show.
